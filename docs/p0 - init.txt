I'm inside the root of a Vue 3 + Vite project folder. 
Please configure and Scaffold the project with the following:

🔧 Install the following dependencies via npm:
- primevue
- primeicons
- pinia
- vue-router
- axios
- cypress (dev dependency)

🧱 Project setup:
- Configure `vite.config.js` if needed to support PrimeVue and Cypress
- Update `main.js` to include:
  - PrimeVue + a default theme (use saga-blue)
  - PrimeIcons
  - Pinia store
  - Vue Router

📂 Create folder structure:
- /components
- /pages
- /stores
- /router

📄 Generate the following files:
1. `src/router/index.js` with routes:
   - `/` → HomePage.vue
   - Fallback redirect to `/`
2. `src/pages/HomePage.vue` with H1: “Welcome to Reader Study Dashboard”
3. `src/components/MainLayout.vue` that includes a topbar and `<router-view />`
4. Wrap HomePage in MainLayout

🧪 Add basic Cypress support (init with `npx cypress open`) and a placeholder test for HomePage.

💡 Note: I don’t need Tailwind or DaisyUI. Use PrimeVue components only.

Implement JWT-based login and signup pages using PrimeVue components.

📄 In `src/pages/LoginPage.vue`:
- Add form with PrimeVue InputText for email and password
- Add a login button (p-button)
- On submit:
  - POST to `/auth/jwt/login` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  - On success, store `access_token` in `localStorage`
  - Navigate to `/dashboard`
  - Show a toast if login fails

📄 In `src/pages/SignupPage.vue`:
- Form inputs:
  - Email (InputText)
  - Password (Password input)
  - Age bracket (Dropdown)
  - Gender (Dropdown)
  - Years clinical experience (InputNumber)
  - Years dermatology experience (InputNumber)
  - Role (Dropdown from mock roles)
- Use mock role list from Pinia store or local file:
```js
[{ id: 1, name: "GP" }, { id: 2, name: "NP" }, { id: 3, name: "Dermatologist" }]

On submit:

POST to /auth/register/register with JSON payload

On success, redirect to /login

On failure, display error using PrimeVue Toast

🔒 Store the access_token in localStorage on login
🌐 Use Axios for all API requests

Optional: create a shared PrimeVue form component if logic overlaps.

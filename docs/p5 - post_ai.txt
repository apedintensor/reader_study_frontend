Update `CasePage.vue` to support the **Post-AI phase** after the user completes the Pre-AI assessment.

---

🧠 Logic:
- Detect if the current case has already been completed Pre-AI (from `caseStore`)
- If so, render the Post-AI section:
  - Call `/ai_outputs/case/{id}`
  - Display the Top 5 predictions using PrimeVue Chart or ProgressBars
    - Each should show the `prediction.name`, `rank`, and `confidence_score`

---

📋 Then render the **same form again**, but with:
- Labeled inputs like “Updated Diagnosis 1”
- “Updated Confidence”, “Updated Management”, etc.

Use the same components:
- 3 InputText fields
- 2 sliders (confidence + certainty)
- Dropdown for updated management strategy
- Optional free-text

---

✅ On “Next” button click:
- Submit `AssessmentCreate` to `/assessments/` with:
```js
{
  is_post_ai: true,
  user_id: <from store>,
  case_id: <from route>,
  change_diagnosis_after_ai: true/false,
  change_management_after_ai: true/false,
  ai_usefulness: "very", "somewhat", "no", etc.
  confidence_level_top1: <slider>,
  management_confidence: <slider>,
  certainty_level: <slider>
}
Submit 3 updated diagnoses to /diagnoses/ using assessment_id

Submit updated management to /management_plans/

🧭 After submission:

Call caseStore.markCaseComplete(caseId)

Navigate to next case /case/:nextId or to /complete if all done

💡 Notes:

Show both Pre-AI and Post-AI forms side-by-side or toggle with a tab

Cache Post-AI form data in localStorage before submitting

Add a transition animation between phases for better UX

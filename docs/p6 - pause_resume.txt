Enhance the caseStore and UI to support session resume and case navigation.

---

📦 In `caseStore.js`:
- Track progress state for each case:
```js
{
  caseId: Number,
  preCompleted: Boolean,
  postCompleted: Boolean
}
Persist this progress map to localStorage after each update

On app startup, load from localStorage via loadProgressFromCache()

Expose a method getIncompleteCases() that returns next available case

📄 In DashboardPage.vue:

Show a PrimeVue DataTable or PanelGrid with:

Case ID

Pre-AI status ✅/❌

Post-AI status ✅/❌

Include:

A “Start/Resume” button → goes to the next incomplete case

A dropdown or sidebar with all case IDs (or labels) → lets user jump to any case via /case/:id

📚 UI Suggestions:

Use PrimeVue Sidebar or PanelMenu for navigation

Highlight completed vs. pending cases with colored icons or status labels

Disable jumping to Post-AI if Pre-AI isn’t completed

🧠 Business Logic:

Resume logic should:

Auto-navigate to the first case where preCompleted === false

If all pre-complete, go to first post-incomplete

If all complete, route to /complete

🛑 Do NOT:

Require sequential answering — users may skip and return later

Overwrite remote data unless user explicitly submits the form

💡 Tip: Show a toast or dialog if user tries to access a post-AI page without finishing pre-AI.

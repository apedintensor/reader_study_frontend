Create two Pinia stores in the `/stores/` folder:

---

📁 `userStore.js` should contain:
- `user` object: `{ id, email, role, token }`
- `setUser(userObj)` – sets user and token, stores to localStorage
- `logout()` – clears user and token, wipes localStorage
- `loadFromLocalStorage()` – loads user state on app start

---

📁 `caseStore.js` should manage case flow:
- `cases`: an array of case objects from `/cases/` API
- `currentIndex`: the index of the currently viewed case
- `completedCases`: list of case IDs marked complete
- `loadCases()` – fetches from `/cases/` and populates `cases`
- `markCaseComplete(caseId)` – adds ID to completed list
- `goToNextCase()` – increments `currentIndex`
- `getCurrentCase()` – returns case at `currentIndex`

🔁 Also include:
- logic to persist completed cases and index to localStorage
- support for resuming where the user left off

🧾 Assume each case from `/cases/` includes:
```js
{
  id: Number,
  ground_truth_diagnosis_id: Number,
  typical_diagnosis: Boolean,
  created_at: String,
  images: [{ id, image_url, case_id }],
  case_metadata_relation: { age, gender, ... },
  ai_outputs: [{ rank, confidence_score, prediction: { name } }]
}
